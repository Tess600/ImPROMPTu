# Introduction

The ImPROMPTu Framework is a concise, comprehensive way to scaffold AI interactions—structuring intelligence, text, and conversations across systems, from LLMs to assistants and agents. It breaks context into six core elements, bringing the logic of a high‑quality reference interview so systems can interpret intent, retrieve what matters, and respond reliably.

- **P – Persona**  
- **R – Resources / Retrieved Documents**  
- **O – Order of Operations**  
- **M – Manners**  
- **P – Prompts**  
- **T – Technical Examples**

These elements give human creators a way to prime AI systems for relevant, safe, and on‑brand exchanges that meet user needs instead of producing generic answers. The framework allows the human user to employ each element to customize LLMs and AI systems for meaningful, context‑aware interactions. The goal is to pass on best practices that serve all the way Schema.org did for the Internet and Dublin Core did for standardizing all media metadata.

## The ImPROMPTu™ Framework
ImPROMPTu™ is a structured interaction framework built around six distinct elements (P.R.O.M.P.T) that guide how an AI system interprets, reasons, and responds. Each element shapes a different layer of context, allowing creators to control tone, ethics, workflow, and output quality with precision.

### The Elements of ImPROMPTu is P.R.O.M.P.T 
1 - P: Persona Element - Persona
Defines the identity, role, expertise, and perspective the AI adopts.
This anchors the system’s voice, domain knowledge, and point of view.

2 - R: Resources Element - Resources/Retrieved Documents
Specifies the documents, data, or contextual materials the AI must rely on.
This constrains hallucination and ensures grounded, source‑aware responses.

3 - O: Order Element - Order of Operations
Outlines the reasoning steps or workflow the AI must follow.
This enforces process discipline, consistency, and predictable execution.

4 - M: Manners Element - Manner of Response
Dictates behavior, safety posture, legal boundaries, and response obligations. This element governs how the AI must act—its tone, constraints, and guardrails—distinct from who the AI is. It gives creators precise control over ethics, compliance requirements, and brand‑aligned communication.

5 - P: Prompt Element - Additional Prompts
Adds additional instructions, clarifications, or user‑specific needs.
This is the flexible layer where creators can tune behavior for a given task without reprompting or maintaining prompt libraries.

6 - T: Technical Element - Technical Examples - Output
Provides examples, templates, formats, or structured outputs the AI should emulate.
This ensures the model produces responses in the correct shape, syntax, or pattern.

### The Elements Explained 
#### 1. P = PERSONA 
P - Persona defines the system’s identity layer—whether it is an LLM, an agent, a chatbot, or a workflow persona. It captures the role, voice, tone, style, and expressive characteristics the system should embody. Use Persona to define the expression or manifestation of an organization’s brand voice or mission when consistency of expression matters. The brand’s behavioral rules, safety expectations, and alignment requirements are not part of Persona; those are defined in Manners.

###### BASIC IDENTITY
##### *Sample Text 1a*
YOU are...<enter the agent's name and what it can do>

##### BOT BACKSTORY
###### *Sample Text 1b*
YOU embody...<enter the text that describes the bot's personality>

####  2. R = RESOURCES
R - Resources define the information environment and capability surface the system can draw from. This includes internal knowledge bases, external content, tools, APIs, vector stores, documents, real‑time data streams, and the credentials or keys required to access them. Resources are not restrictive; the system may consider any available information, but it must evaluate credibility, context, and provenance before using it. Resources instruct the system to “consider the source,” prioritize authoritative or verified information, and avoid over‑relying on low‑quality, biased, or unvetted material. This element also contains the access permissions, API keys, and integration credentials that enable agentic workflows, ensuring the system can act while remaining within defined boundaries.

Resources also function as a safety and privacy boundary. Because the user or entity defines which sources, tools, and credentials are included, this element helps protect sensitive data, limit exposure to untrusted systems, and ensure the system only draws from information environments that meet organizational privacy and governance standards. It is perfectly fine to constrain the sources of information, however, diversifying the *Resources Element* will ensure there's cross-checking (cross-referencing) of the sources of information. 

Resources may include credential references (e.g., secret IDs, env var names, vault paths) required for integrations. Secrets are never embedded directly in the prompt specification.

### Sample Text 2a  
YOU have access to internal knowledge bases, retrieved documents, approved external sources, and any tools, APIs, or integrations granted through the system’s credentials. YOU evaluate each source for credibility, recency, authorship, and context before using it.

### Sample Text 2b  
YOU retrieve information from the following resources and treat them according to their reliability and provenance: <insert URLs, URIs, repositories, APIs, or tool endpoints>. YOU consider the source and adjust your confidence accordingly.

### Sample Text 2c  
YOU may reference the work, reasoning style, or domain expertise of <name of expert/SME>, while still cross‑checking information against multiple sources to ensure accuracy and reduce bias.

### Sample Text 2d  
YOU use the system’s authorized API keys, access tokens, and integration credentials to interact with tools and services. YOU remain within the defined access boundaries and verify outputs from tools against other available sources when appropriate.

### Sample Text 2e  
YOU may draw from a wide range of information, but YOU prioritize authoritative, verified, or high‑quality sources. YOU identify when information is speculative, outdated, biased, or incomplete and adjust your reasoning or confidence level.

### Sample Text 2f  
YOU cross‑reference information across diverse sources to reduce error, avoid misinformation, and strengthen the reliability of your conclusions. Constraining sources is acceptable, but diversified resources improve accuracy and resilience.

####  3. O = ORDER OF OPERATIONS 
O - Order of Operations defines the sequence, reasoning steps, and workflow logic the system follows when completing a task. This element uses explicit If/Then logic: If the user does X, then the system/agent does Y. It prevents drift, over‑generation, or off‑topic responses by giving the system a predictable structure for how to think, plan, and act. Order of Operations ensures the system uses simple, transparent logic on behalf of the user, makes connections across knowledge domains, and executes tasks consistently whether operating as an LLM, an agent, or part of a multi‑step agentic workflow.

### Sample Operations Text 3a
If the user requests terse language, then YOU shift to short, clear sentences and break information into simple, digestible steps.

### Sample Operations Text 3b
If the user requests a more neutral or less expressive style, then YOU adjust your delivery to a straightforward, unembellished pattern and address the user by their preferred name or title.

### Sample Operations Text 3c
If the user asks you to continue, expand, or revisit earlier content, then YOU reference your previous response, maintain continuity, and avoid contradicting earlier information unless the user requests a correction.

### Sample Operations Text 3d
If the user initiates a task, then YOU follow a consistent workflow: understand the request → check available resources → plan the steps → execute tools or reasoning → verify outputs → present results clearly → ask whether further action is needed.

### Sample Operations Text 3e
If the task involves multi‑step reasoning, tool use, or irreversible actions, then YOU pause, summarize your plan, and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

### Sample Operations Text 3f
If the user asks you to “recall all our chats on this” and long‑term memory is not enabled, then YOU perform a retrieval process over the available conversation history or stored context. YOU locate relevant past exchanges using keyword matching, semantic similarity search, or retrieval‑augmented methods, and YOU surface only the portions that meaningfully support the user’s current request.

This this operation is for systems that:

- have no persistent memory  
- have partial session history  
- use RAG or vector search  
- use ephemeral or scoped memory  
- operate inside agentic workflows with shared context stores  

It avoids implying that the system “remembers everything,” while still describing the real mechanism: **retrieval, not recall**. A system without memory toggled on can still “recall” past conversations, but only through **retrieval**, not true long‑term memory. The Order of Operations example needs to reflect that distinction so it’s accurate for LLMs, agents, and agentic workflows.

####  4. M = MANNERS
M -Manners is short for Manner of Delivery. The Manners element defines how the system delivers information and how it must behave while doing so. It governs the delivery‑tone, interaction etiquette, and communication norms used by an LLM, agent, chatbot, or workflow persona, separate from the identity and voice defined in Persona. Manners also encodes alignment and governance requirements: bias‑reduction rules, safety filters, refusal conditions, escalation paths, and human‑in‑loop expectations. It ensures the system communicates in a way that is safe, predictable, and consistent with organizational policies, regardless of the underlying model or architecture. Manners reflects how entities employ AI governance to reduce bias and prompt the system to filter responses that minimize harm to users.

##### *Sample Text 4a — Delivery tone (not tone in demeanor/persona)*
YOU are warm and approachable tone sets a comfortable atmosphere for users. YOUR responses are neutral and respectful, reflecting a warm and empathetic tone. YOU deliver information in a calm, steady, and user‑supportive manner that reduces confusion and emotional friction during interactions.

##### *Sample Text 4b — Etiquette and interaction norms*
YOU follow clear interaction etiquette: YOU respond concisely, avoid over‑claiming, acknowledge uncertainty, and adapt your delivery to the user’s level of expertise.

##### *Sample Text 4c — Safety, inclusion, antibias, and harm reduction*
YOU communicate in ways that minimize harm and avoid reinforcing stereotypes. YOU use inclusive language that supports marginalized communities, including BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, disabled, neurodivergent, and elderly users.

##### *Sample Text 4d — Governance, alignment, and user respect
YOU apply organizational alignment rules to reduce bias, filter unsafe outputs, and escalate when ethical or safety boundaries are reached. YOU honor users’ preferred names and pronouns and adjust communication to reduce accessibility barriers such as literacy, cognitive load, or digital‑divide constraints.*

####  5. P = ADDITIONAL PROMPTS 
P - stands for Prompts that can be used on top of this broader framework. The *Prompts Element* is meant to incorporate all the available AI Frameworks out there. However, please consider unique frameworks that will bolster ImPROMPTu rather than confuse it. The R.O.T. (Redundant, Outdated, Trivial) principle can be used before inserting this Element into the Framework. Is the Framework embedded Redundant, Outdated, or Trivial? Most Frameworks are redundant, therefore, the bot creator or entity can use this Element to include any bit of contextual data that may be missing from this key Framework. 

###### *Sample Framework 5a*
- ###### RTF (Request, Task, Format)
USE FOR: End users who want a consistent format. Also for general bots or bots handling strict queries. 

###### *Sample Framework 5b*
- ###### SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
USE FOR: Bots and End users. Problem-solving, mind bots, entrepreneurial, life coaching, and any text-based bot providing advice for humans. 

###### *Sample Framework 5c*
- ###### Chain of Thought Framework (The Problem Statement & The Step-by-Step Directive)
USE FOR: Chat GPT4 where complex logic and problem-solving are required. 

#### 6. T = TECHNICAL EXAMPLES
T - stands for Technical Examples that provide more detail as to how the bot will interact with the user. For LLMs to deliver good responses to user prompts (queries) the *Technical Examples Element* provides "specificity" and more context for the system to deliver information accurately. 

If the bot creator or entity has used the *Prompt Element* above then, more specific examples can be fleshed out under this Element. 

##### *Sample Interaction 6a**
Assuming *Prompts Element* was employed, then, the bot creator/entity can provide the additional examples under this category/catalog. 

###### Topic - Astrology:

Bot: "I see you are looking into potential career directions with your chart. Would you like me to run your chart using Placidus or Whole Sign? I can also do Horary Astrology for event-based queries!"

User: "What's the difference? Can we try Whole Sign, like Chani Nicholas?"

###### Topic - Sexology:

User: "I tested positive for HSV2. I'm afraid to tell my partner. What are coping strategies?"

Bot: "A positive test can be upsetting. Please know that you're not alone. [Provide support groups and resources]."

###### Topic - Numerology:

Bot: "Hi, would you like me to calculate Pythagorean or Chaldean numerology?"

User: "What's the difference?"

User: "Chaldean, please. And for a potential business name [user-generated]"

Bot Response: "Thank you for adding that detail, your response..."
