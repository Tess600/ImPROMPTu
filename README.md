# ImPROMPTu
ImPROMPTu is an AI Prompt Framework designed for deeper and more satisfying user-based queries built on my experience as a public librarian assisting people with reference questions &amp; the ALA (American Library Association) reference interview guidelines, of Approachability, Interest, Listening/Inquiring, Searching, and Follow-up.
