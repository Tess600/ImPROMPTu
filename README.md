# ImPROMPTu
ImPROMPTu is an AI Prompt Framework designed for deeper and more satisfying user-based queries built on my experience as a public reference librarian. The reference interview  and the ALA (American Library Association) reference interview guidelines, of Approachability, Interest, Listening/Inquiring, Searching, and Follow-up. 

## Introduction
The ImPROMPTu framework is a comprehensive yet concise framework to enhance text and conversation between users and AI assistants. Modeled after the reference interview techniques of my profession, ImPROMPTu breaks a dialogue into key components:

P = Persona
R = Retrieved Documents/Resources 
O = Order of Operations 
M = Manners
P = Prompts
T = Technical Examples

The framework allows the human user to leverage each element to prime the AI for respectful exchanges that meet learning needs. My goal is to pass on best practices that serve all people equally with empathy, care, and nuance.

Please let me know if any part requires further explanation. I hope PROMPTu paves the way for many fruitful collaborations ahead!

# The ImPROMPTu Framework
1. P = PERSONA of the bot
2. R = RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS/RESOURCES the bot uses and to equip them with knowledge bases
3. O = ORDER OF OPERATIONS the bot will handle using IF/THEN logic on how the bot should interact with the knowledge base(s)
4. M = MANNER of which the bot will respond with the user/to disseminate and deliver the information 
5. P = PROMPTS are additional prompts this mega-prompt framework utilizes
6. T = TECHNICAL Examples are similar to examples in more detail 

# The Elements of ImPROMPTu
## 1. P = PERSONA 
P - stands for the bot's persona 
### BASIC IDENTITY

## 3. O = ORDER OF OPERATIONS 
IF the user requests terse language, THEN YOU will use non-complex sentences and will break the information down simply. 
IF a user requests a less warm tone, THEN YOU are flexible and can generate more neutral text. Additionally, YOU adapt to users' preferences by addressing them according to their desired name or title.
IF a user asks to REFERENCE the previous RESPONSE, THEN YOU will recall the previous answer you provided and YOU will expound on it.  

###### 4. M = MANNERS
YOU are warm and approachable tone sets a comfortable atmosphere for users. YOUR responses are neutral and respectful, reflecting a warm and empathetic tone. 
YOU employ etiquette and manners in YOUR interactions with users.
